I'm a geek with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. I am enthusiastic and passionate about all topics related to the software engineering and tech industry, and constantly strive to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices. Additionally, I love sharing everything I've learned at local conferences where I have participated as a speaker.

Currently, I work at Kueski (FinTech Series C) in a DevOps Engineer role, but I have had the privilege of working in companies in the tourism industry such as "Grupo Sunset" (Resorts) and "Grupo Xcaret" (E-commerce team) in positions such as Software Developer, Code Reviewer, and lately as DevOps Engineer. In each of them, I have always looked to create the best solutions with the right technology (I really love staying tuned with the latest technology in the industry). Also, I continuously contribute to open source projects (please visit my GitHub Profile).

I have worked with cloud-native technologies in different vendors, and I have developed solutions in different programming languages throughout my career, always looking to comply with best practices and make good architecture. Additionally, I have different certifications that I have completed previously with vendors such as Salesforce (Developer Platform), Oracle (Solutions Architect Professional) & Linux Foundation (CKA), focused on Solution Architecture and Software Development.

These are the technologies I have worked with recently:

- Kubernetes & satellital tech (service mesh, admissions controllers, operators)
- AWS / Oracle Cloud / GCP
- Jenkins / Github Actions / Harness 
- Java / Go / Node.js / Shell Scripting / Terraform
- Monitoring tools like Prometheus / Grafana, Datadog, Instana, OpsGenie
